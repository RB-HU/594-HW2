### 1. It took me approximately 12 hours to complete this assignment.

### 2.The most challenging part was implementing the BST logic, specifically the recursive approach for tree traversal. And when implementing the remove method, I need to think about many edge cases.

### 3. No, I completed this assignment independently on my own.

### 4. I learned the logic of BST node deletion, like how to properly reassign parent and child pointers when replacing a node. This deepened my understanding of tree structure.
